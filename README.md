This package describes the workflow and relation between the PDB database from the PDB database and how to map the PDB IDs to HGNC symbols. It takes into account the PDB ID along with the corresponding transcripts and HGNC symbls and HGNC transcripts. The biggest part of this code is representing the relations between PDB chains and how they map to specific HGNC transcripts and symbols.
